This is a modification to the Graphormer architecture presented in the paper Do Transformers Really Perform Bad
for Graph Representation? https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05234
The aim of this modification is to unify the ranges of the spatial and edge encoding which leads to an enhancement in end tasks.
