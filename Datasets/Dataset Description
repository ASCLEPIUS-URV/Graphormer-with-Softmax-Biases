The datasets used to train the model

• ESOL, Delaney [2004] a set consisting of 1128 molecules for the prediction of water
solubility. Graphs in this dataset range between (2 - 55) nodes.
• FreeSolv, Mobley and Guthrie [2014] contains both experimental and calcu-
lated hydration free energies of small neutral molecules in water. The set used
was comprised of 639 molecules represented as graphs ranging between (2 - 24) nodes.
• Lipophilicity, Wu et al. [2017] The set contains 4200 molecules. It measures the
hydrophobicity, i.e., lipophilicity, which is the dissolvability of substance in non-polar
solvents. The graphs in this set range between (7 - 115) nodes.
